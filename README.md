# 👋 Hi, I'm Jasmin_also_Tianhua 🌟  

💻 **Background:**  
AI enthusiast and cross-disciplinary explorer in the biomedical field.  
My research focuses on **genomics** and **EEG signal analysis**, with a deep curiosity about the **mathematical essence of computational biology**. Recently, Recently, I’ve been diving into hands-on wet lab experiments, hoping to bridge the gap between computational models and practical biology. 

🎯 **My Goal:**  
100% dedicated to exploring the intersection of **life sciences and AI**, striving to push the boundaries of our understanding of life through technology.  

🎶 **Hobbies:**  
Beyond research, I’m a lover of life and creativity:  
- 🎹 Playing piano and 🎸 guitar, blending logic and emotion.  
- 🥾 Hiking to recharge my mind and 📸 capturing fleeting moments through photography.  
- 🧬 Exploring the mysteries of life and occasionally diving into philosophy and mysticism.  
- ✍️ Writing down random thoughts, whether it’s about science, art, or the quirky world around me.  
- 🌌 Constantly dreaming about combining music, AI, and art into something extraordinary.

## 🚀 Current Focus  
- **What I'm working on:**  
  - Developing deep learning models for EEG signal classification, decoding the "language" of brain activity.  
  - Applying AI algorithms in genomics to uncover the secrets between genetic codes and health.  
  - Learning the basics of wet lab experiments, like cell culture and DNA extraction—embracing the joy of hands-on work (and the pain of experimental failures).  

- **Future Plans:**  
  - Combining AI and music to create models that can "jam" with me in real time.  
  - Delving deeper into the mathematical foundation of computational biology to unlock hidden patterns!
